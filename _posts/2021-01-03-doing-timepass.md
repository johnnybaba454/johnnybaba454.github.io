I can't tell how bored I am!! I want to something interesting but don't know what to do. Help me help me. Feels like everything is boring. I don't want to watch anything. I don't want to study. Nothing, literally nothing. I am going to start cycling tomorrow and college is going to start from tomorrow as well. How should I get rid of this boredom??
